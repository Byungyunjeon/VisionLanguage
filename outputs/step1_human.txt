It seems like your child might be feeling something isn't quite right or complete. Even if you're not sure exactly what it is, acknowledging that feeling can be important. 

If he becomes upset, try to restore things to how they were before or offer a small repair step—like taking a moment to chat with him about what’s bothering him. Keep your words clear and simple.

Remember, sometimes just knowing that you understand his feelings can make a big difference. If the behavior repeats, it might help to notice any changes or interruptions right before he becomes upset. This can give you more clues about what might be triggering his response.

It's okay if you're not sure; parenting neurodivergent children can come with many uncertainties. Your support and understanding are incredibly valuable.
