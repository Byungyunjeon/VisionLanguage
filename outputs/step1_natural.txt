What the system is picking up most is **wanting something to feel 'fixed' or complete**.
This is a low-confidence guess, so several explanations may still fit.

How to respond (neutral, practical):
- Acknowledge what seems 'off' for him (even if you’re not sure what it is).
- Offer a small repair step (restore, redo, or clearly mark what changed).
- Keep your wording short and predictable; avoid adding extra demands.

Signal summary (same meaning, softer wording):
- Likely need: repair integrity (confidence 0.15). Something felt 'wrong' or broken. He became upset and wanted it restored. Repairing the detail can help him feel safe. there may be some risk of escalation, and the state may shift quickly context: school entrance, noisy hallway

If this repeats, it can help to note what was changed, removed, interrupted, or left unfinished right before the reaction.
