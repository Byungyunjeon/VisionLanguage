It sounds like your child might be feeling a bit sad as they enter the noisy hallway of school. It's completely normal for them to feel this way, given the environment.

Here are some gentle suggestions:

- Speak in short, calm sentences.
- If you can, try to reduce any additional stimulation, such as noise or bright lights.
- Offer one simple next step and then give them a moment to process it.

Remember, every day is different, and your child's feelings might change. Be there for them as they navigate these moments.
