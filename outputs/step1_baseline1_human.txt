It sounds like your child might be experiencing a moment where something feels "off" or broken. In a busy environment like the school hallway, this can make them upset and anxious. Focusing on restoring that sense of safety can be really helpful for them. Sometimes just acknowledging their feelings and finding ways to make the space feel more secure can make a big difference.
